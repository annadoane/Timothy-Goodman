        <p>Timothy Goodman draws significant inspiration from Keith Haring, whose vibrant and energetic style resonates deeply with Goodman’s own artistic approach. Haring's emphasis on social issues and community engagement mirrors Goodman’s commitment to addressing contemporary themes through art. The bold lines, playful figures, and impactful messaging that define Haring's work serve as a backdrop for Goodman, encouraging him to explore the intersection of art and activism. This influence is evident in Goodman’s own murals and public installations, where he seeks to foster connection and provoke thought, much like Haring did during his time. By channeling Haring's spirit, Goodman continues to push boundaries in his art, aiming to inspire dialogue and reflection in the viewer.</p>
